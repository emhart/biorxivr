Description: The bioRxiv preprint server (http://www.biorxiv.org) is a website where scientists can post preprints of scholarly texts in biology. Users can search and download PDFs in bulk from the preprint server. The text of abstracts are stored as raw text within R, and PDFs can easily be saved and imported for text mining with packages such as 'tm'.
